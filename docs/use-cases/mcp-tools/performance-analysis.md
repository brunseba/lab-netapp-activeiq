# Performance Analysis

## Overview

Performance analysis is a critical DevOps use case that leverages the NetApp ActiveIQ MCP server through APIM to monitor, analyze, and optimize storage system performance. This use case demonstrates how DevOps teams can proactively identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations through automated workflows.

## DevOps Integration Patterns

### Performance Dashboard Integration

```python
# Example: Performance metrics integration
from netapp_mcp_client import NetAppMCPClient
from apim_client import APIMClient

class PerformanceAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.apim = APIMClient()
        self.mcp_client = NetAppMCPClient()

    async def get_cluster_performance(self, cluster_id: str):
        """Fetch comprehensive cluster performance metrics"""
        workflow_request = {
            "workflow": "cluster_performance_analysis",
            "parameters": {
                "cluster_id": cluster_id,
                "metrics": ["iops", "latency", "throughput", "cpu", "memory"],
                "timeframe": "1_hour"
            }
        }

        # Route through APIM for standardized access
        response = await self.apim.execute_temporal_workflow(workflow_request)
        return response.performance_data

    async def analyze_performance_trends(self, svm_id: str):
        """Analyze performance trends for SVM"""
        trend_data = await self.apim.get_performance_trends(
            resource_type="svm",
            resource_id=svm_id,
            analysis_period="7_days"
        )

        return {
            "current_performance": trend_data.current_metrics,
            "trend_analysis": trend_data.trends,
            "predictions": trend_data.ai_predictions,
            "recommendations": trend_data.optimization_suggestions
        }
```

### Alerting and Notification Workflows
