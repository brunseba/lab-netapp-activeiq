# MCP Tools Use Cases Overview

This section contains use cases specifically designed for **Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration** with NetApp ActiveIQ. These use cases focus on metadata management, tagging, and annotation capabilities that enhance the automation and organization of NetApp storage resources.

## 🎯 Purpose

MCP tools provide a structured way to:

- **Tag and categorize** storage objects (SVMs, volumes, LUNs)
- **Attach custom metadata** for organizational purposes
- **Search and filter** resources based on annotations
- **Automate compliance** and governance workflows
- **Enable cost tracking** and resource allocation

## 🔧 Common MCP Integration Patterns

### 1. Event-Based Metadata

- Create events with custom annotations
- Associate events with storage objects
- Use event annotations as metadata containers

### 2. Search and Discovery

- Query events by annotation content
- Filter objects by multiple metadata criteria
- Aggregate results for reporting

### 3. Automation Workflows

- Implement tagging standards
- Automate compliance checking
- Enable resource lifecycle management

## 🎨 Metadata Schema Examples

### Project-Based Tagging

```json
{
  "project": "quarterly-reporting",
  "owner": "finance-team",
  "environment": "production",
  "cost-center": "IT-001"
}
```

### Compliance Tagging

```json
{
  "compliance": "sox",
  "criticality": "high",
  "data-classification": "confidential",
  "retention": "7-years"
}
```

### Team-Based Organization

```json
{
  "team": "storage-admins",
  "contact": "admin@company.com",
  "backup-schedule": "daily",
  "maintenance-window": "sunday-2am"
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Use Case**: Select the most appropriate use case for your needs
2. **Review the Sequence Diagrams**: Understand the API interaction patterns
3. **Implement Authentication**: Set up proper API credentials
4. **Test with Sample Data**: Start with non-production resources
5. **Scale Your Implementation**: Apply to production environments
