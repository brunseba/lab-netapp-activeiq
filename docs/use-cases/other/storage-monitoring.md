```

### Performance Questions

```
"What are the top 10 volumes by IOPS?"
"Show me performance trends for the last 24 hours"
"Which volumes have high latency?"
"What's the average throughput for our NFS volumes?"
"Are there any performance bottlenecks right now?"
```

### Health Questions

```
"What's the overall health status of our storage?"
"Are there any failed disks or hardware issues?"
"Show me all critical alerts"
"What clusters need attention?"
"Is everything running normally?"
```

## Automated Monitoring Workflows

### 1. Daily Health Report

```python
# Automated daily health check
daily_report = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now(),
    "cluster_health": check_all_clusters(),
    "capacity_warnings": check_capacity_thresholds(),
    "critical_events": get_new_critical_events(),
    "performance_outliers": check_performance_baselines(),
    "recommendations": generate_recommendations()
}
```

### 2. Capacity Threshold Alerts

```python
# Monitor capacity thresholds
for volume in get_all_volumes():
    if volume.utilization > 90:
        send_alert(f"Volume {volume.name} is {volume.utilization}% full")
    elif volume.utilization > 80:
        send_warning(f"Volume {volume.name} approaching capacity")
```

### 3. Performance Anomaly Detection

```python
# Detect performance anomalies
current_metrics = get_performance_metrics()
baseline_metrics = get_baseline_performance()

if current_metrics.latency > baseline_metrics.latency * 1.5:
