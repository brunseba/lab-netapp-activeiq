**Key Steps**:

- Search events using annotation filters (e.g., `owner:team_a`, `environment:production`)
- Parse event results to extract unique resource keys
- Retrieve full object details for each matching resource
- Present categorized search results grouped by object type
- Support advanced search patterns for compliance, cost tracking, and resource management

**Common Errors**: No matching results, invalid search syntax, deleted resources, pagination handling.

## NetApp ActiveIQ Administrative Philosophy

NetApp ActiveIQ Unified Manager follows an **event-driven administrative approach** that provides comprehensive metadata management capabilities through its built-in event system. This philosophy aligns with enterprise requirements for:

### Audit and Compliance

- **Complete Audit Trail**: All metadata changes are recorded as events with timestamps and user attribution
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Events provide the documentation trail required for SOX, GDPR, and other compliance frameworks
- **Change Management**: Integration with ITSM systems through event-based workflows

### Enterprise Integration

- **RBAC Integration**: Leverages existing role-based access control for metadata management
- **Workflow Automation**: Events can trigger automated responses and notifications
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Metadata can be aggregated and analyzed through the event system

### Operational Excellence

- **Centralized Management**: All metadata is managed through the same interface used for monitoring and administration
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach ensures uniform metadata handling across all object types
- **Scalability**: Event-based system scales with enterprise growth and complexity

## Tagging and Labeling Approaches

NetApp ActiveIQ API provides multiple approaches for adding labels/tags to objects:

### Event Annotations

- **Purpose**: Add metadata to events for categorization, workflow integration, and reporting
- **Format**: Free-form string (recommended: key-value pairs like `priority:high,team:storage`)
- **API Endpoint**: `PATCH /management-server/events/{key}`
- **Use Cases**:
  - ITSM integration (ticket numbers, workflow IDs)
  - Priority classification and routing
  - Team assignment and responsibility tracking
  - Compliance and audit metadata

### Volume Name Tags

- **Purpose**: Create consistent volume naming during LUN creation
- **Format**: String that becomes part of the volume name (e.g., `sample_volume` ‚Üí `NSLM_sample_volume`)
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /storage-provider/luns` with `volume.name_tag` parameter
- **Use Cases**:
  - Standardized naming conventions
  - Environment identification (dev, test, prod)
  - Application or project grouping
  - Cost center or department tracking
