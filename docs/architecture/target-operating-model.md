# Target Operating Model: NetApp Operations with Temporal Workflows

This document defines the Target Operating Model (TOM) for NetApp storage operations, showcasing three operational paradigms: traditional manual operations, MCP-enabled automation, and the advanced Temporal.io-powered durable execution model.

## Executive Summary

The Target Operating Model demonstrates the evolution from manual NetApp operations to AI-assisted automation, culminating in **durable, fault-tolerant workflows** powered by Temporal.io. This new paradigm ensures that complex, long-running storage operations never fail permanently and can recover from any failure without data loss or manual intervention.

### Durable Workflow Benefits

#### 🔄 **Fault Tolerance**

- **Automatic Retries**: Failed activities retry with exponential backoff
- **Partial Failure Recovery**: Resume from last successful checkpoint
- **Worker Failures**: Workflows survive worker restarts and deployments
- **Infrastructure Failures**: Persist through cluster outages

#### 📈 **Complex Orchestration**

- **Multi-Step Processes**: Coordinate dozens of NetApp operations
- **Conditional Logic**: Smart decision-making based on intermediate results
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause for approvals, resume automatically
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent operations concurrently

#### 🔍 **Observability**

- **Workflow History**: Complete execution trace with timing
- **State Inspection**: View current workflow state and variables
- **Replay Capability**: Debug issues by replaying exact execution
- **Metrics Integration**: Built-in metrics for monitoring

#### ⏱️ **Long-Running Operations**

- **Days/Weeks Duration**: Handle migration and upgrade workflows
- **Scheduled Operations**: Cron-like scheduling with durability
- **Event-Driven**: React to NetApp events and external triggers
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on workflow completion

## Temporal Workflow Patterns for NetApp

### 1. Simple Request-Response Pattern

```python
@workflow.defn
class SimpleVolumeCreation:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, volume_request: VolumeRequest) -> VolumeResult:
        # Single activity execution
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            create_volume_activity,
            volume_request,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
        )

@activity.defn
async def create_volume_activity(request: VolumeRequest) -> VolumeResult:
    # Call MCP server
    mcp_client = get_mcp_client()
    result = await mcp_client.call_tool("create_volume", request.dict())
    return VolumeResult.parse_obj(result)
```

### 2. Complex Multi-Step Workflow

```python
@workflow.defn
class SVMEnvironmentSetup:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, setup_request: SVMSetupRequest) -> SVMSetupResult:
        workflow.logger.info(f"Starting SVM setup for {setup_request.team_name}")

        # Step 1: Validate requirements
        validation = await workflow.execute_activity(
            validate_requirements,
            setup_request,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2)
        )

        if not validation.valid:
            raise ApplicationError(f"Validation failed: {validation.errors}")

        # Step 2: Resource allocation
        allocation = await workflow.execute_activity(
            allocate_resources,
            setup_request,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
        )

        # Step 3: Create SVM
        svm = await workflow.execute_activity(
            create_svm,
            allocation,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
        )

        # Step 4: Configure networking (parallel activities)
        network_tasks = [
            workflow.execute_activity(
                create_management_lif,
                svm.uuid,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
            ),
            workflow.execute_activity(
                create_data_lifs,
                svm.uuid,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
            )
        ]

        await asyncio.gather(*network_tasks)

        # Step 5: Human approval for production
        if setup_request.environment == "production":
            approval = await workflow.execute_activity(
                request_approval,
                f"SVM {svm.name} ready for production deployment",
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=24)  # Wait up to 24 hours
            )

            if not approval.approved:
                # Cleanup resources
                await workflow.execute_activity(
                    cleanup_svm,
                    svm.uuid,
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
                )
                raise ApplicationError("Setup not approved")

        # Step 6: Final configuration
        final_config = await workflow.execute_activity(
            finalize_setup,
            svm.uuid,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=15)
        )

        # Step 7: Notification
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            send_completion_notification,
            final_config,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2)
        )

        return SVMSetupResult(
            svm_uuid=svm.uuid,
            svm_name=svm.name,
            access_details=final_config.access_details,
            setup_duration=workflow.now() - workflow.start_time
        )
```

### 3. Event-Driven Workflow

```python
@workflow.defn
class CapacityManagement:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, cluster_uuid: str) -> None:
        # Continuous workflow for capacity management
        while True:
            # Check capacity every hour
            capacity_status = await workflow.execute_activity(
                check_cluster_capacity,
                cluster_uuid,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
            )

            if capacity_status.utilization > 80:
                # Trigger expansion workflow
                await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
                    CapacityExpansionWorkflow.run,
                    cluster_uuid,
                    id=f"expansion-{cluster_uuid}-{workflow.now()}"
                )

            # Wait for next check or external signal
            try:
                await workflow.wait_condition(
                    lambda: False,  # Never true, so always timeout
                    timeout=timedelta(hours=1)
                )
            except TimeoutError:
                continue  # Normal hourly check

            # Handle external signals
            signals = workflow.list_all_signals()
            for signal in signals:
                if signal.name == "emergency_expansion":
                    await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
